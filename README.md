# DSEA-SMOTE

## Code background
In industrial production, the imbalance between sparse failure signals and abundant normal signals
biases fault diagnosis models towards the normal class,
reducing accuracy and reliability. Existing synthetic data
methods help mitigate this but often neglect spatiotemporal long-distance dependencies and local feature similarities, limiting their effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose Deep Squeeze-enhanced Axial Transformer Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (DSEA-SMOTE). This method integrates a specially designed
continuous wavelet transform data filtering preprocessing
technology module that converts one-dimensional time-domain data into a two-dimensional feature map, enhancing model performance while simplifying feature learning.
It then captures spatiotemporal long-distance dependencies and feature similarities in space-time slices through
the novel Squeeze-enhanced Axial Attention mechanism
and Auxiliary Feature Classifier. A Multi-category Sample
Feature Filtering Technology module is also introduced to
further improve synthesis quality. Additionally, we refine
the loss function based on the Auxiliary Feature Classifier
to enhance generation quality. Experimental evaluations
on two real-world datasets show that DSEA-SMOTE outperforms recent techniques. Ablation experiments further
verify the effectiveness of each component in our design.Future work will extend DSEA-SMOTE to medical image
synthesis for rare diseases, remote sensing image synthesis for
extreme natural disasters, radar signal synthesis for aviation
objects, and explore its use with other modalities.

## Code repository introduction
This code repository is the source code of the paper "Deep Squeezze-enhanced Axial Transformer SMOTE: A Novel Approach For Imbalance-bearing Fault Diagnosis". It mainly provides the framework code and related processing code of the novel data synthesis model framework DSEA-SMOTE. It also provides related data files.Below is a schematic diagram of the model framework of the entire paper.

## Subsequent maintenance plan
There is still room for improvement in the readability of the project code. We plan to refactor the code of the entire project and upload the weight file in the future.(2025-3-26)
If you want to see our latest work, you can take a look at our SCQ-CFGRF model project, which is more mature and has uploaded the model's weight file, which can be run directly for testing.(https://github.com/amstlldj/SCQ-CFGRF)
