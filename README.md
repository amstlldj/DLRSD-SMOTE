# DSEA-SMOTE
This code repository is the source code of the paper "Deep Squeezze-enhanced Axial Transformer SMOTE: A Novel Approach For Imbalance-bearing Fault Diagnosis". It mainly provides the framework code and related processing code of the novel data synthesis model framework DSEA-SMOTE. It also provides related data files.Below is a schematic diagram of the model framework of the entire paper.

Below are the results of the model synthesizing samples under extremely unbalanced conditions (BR 1:400) (from left to right: original sample, synthesized sample color map, synthesized sample grayscale map).

Meanwhile, the following is an explanation for the long distance dependence of sample synthesis in space-time and the similarity of overall and local features of space-time slices.
